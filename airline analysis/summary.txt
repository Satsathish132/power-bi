Project Title:

Airline Analysis Dashboard

Tool Used:

Power BI

Objective:

To analyze and visualize airline operational data in order to understand flight performance trends, delays, and cancellations across different origin airports and days of the week.



Dashboard Summary:

 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) at the Top:

473K – Total Number of Flights

299K – Total On-Time Flights

174.18K – Total Delayed Flights

11.78K – Total Cancelled Flights

1.22M minutes – Total Average Delay Duration


These KPIs give an immediate overview of airline operational efficiency.


Visuals and Analysis Components:

1. Bar Chart – Count of Airline Name by Origin Airport:

Shows how many flights each airline has operated from origin airports (DCA, BWI, IAD).

Helps identify the most active airlines at each airport.



2. Donut Charts – Flight Status Breakdown by Origin Airport:

Cancelled Flights and Delayed Flights by origin (DCA, BWI, IAD).

Quickly shows which airports have higher disruptions.



3. Line + Scatter Chart – Flights and Delays by Airport:

Displays the trend of total flights vs. delayed flights for each origin airport.

Useful for comparing delay rates across airports.



4. Clustered Column Chart – Daily Flight Performance:

Shows the count of on-time, delayed, and cancelled flights by Day of the Week.

Highlights which days experience more disruptions or higher efficiency.



5. Slicers – Filters for Dynamic Analysis:

Year

Airline Name

Allows users to interactively explore the data by selecting specific years or airlines.


Conclusion / Insights:

This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of flight performance across airports. Users can:

Monitor delays and cancellations by location and day.

Identify performance trends for specific airlines.

Take data-driven decisions to optimize flight scheduling or improve operational efficiency.
